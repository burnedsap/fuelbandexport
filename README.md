This python code is a slightly modified version of mookie kong(https://github.com/ultramookie/fuelbandexport/blob/master/fuelband-export.py), and leah culvers(https://gist.github.com/leah/5655437) code.

The Nike Fuelband data now gets code from Nike and exports it in a CSV data file.
This CSV file can be used for a number of purposes such as data visualisation.
